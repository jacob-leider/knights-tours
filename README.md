# knights-tours
Playing around with the famous [knight's tour problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour).

# random tour
random_tour.py places the knight in A1 and takes it on a random walk, stopping when the only legal moves take the night to squares it has already visited.

# hamiltonian tour
tour.py places the knight at A1 and computes a knight's tour. This may take a while, as the algorithm used is naive backtracking.
